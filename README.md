If you are using an IDE follow the following steps. If you are using Google Colab, skip to the section after.

### Using GitHub Desktop
If you are using an IDE like Spyder, you'll have to either use GIT (command line interface) or GitHub Desktop. I recommend using GitHub Desktop if you haven't used GIT before. Download GitHub desktop from https://desktop.github.com/ 

Once you've installed and connected your GitHub account to the application. You can clone a repository to your computer using the "Clone a repository from the Internet..." option. Either search for the repository or use the URL function to paste the link from the step above. Select where you want the file to be stored and press "Clone"

By default it will save the file to C:/Users/%User%/Documents/Github/%name of your repo%

Open the cloned folder and you should see the Data for the project "Project 1 Data.csv" along with a readme file. Make a new file here for your Python script. As you make changes to this file, GitHub Desktop will recognize the modified files and ask you to upload to your repository. Enter a quick description on what you worked on and then click commit to main.

Then you can push your changes to GitHub by pressing Push origin.

### Using Google Colab
If you are using Google Colab for completing your project. Go to https://colab.research.google.com/ 


When using Google Colab you cannot clone files other than your code, so you will need to download the files from the GitHub repository. When clicking the green "Code" button on your repository, you should have the option to download zip. Upload the data file in the zip to a new folder on your Google Drive. When you launch Google Colab, create a new notebook, and click the files tab and click the mount Google Drive button.

You should see your Google Drive folders and be able to access the files within.

To access the data for this project in your code, use the file path "drive/MyDrive/%foldername%/Project 1 Data.csv"

Once you have made changes to your Colab file, it will save in your Google Drive. Make sure to upload to GitHub regularly by clicking "File" --> "Save a copy in GitHub". 

You will be asked to sign into GitHub. Once signed in, you should be able to select your repository and push the file. Make sure to change the commit message to describe what you did in the file. It doesn't have to be long, just a short description. Then press OK.

This should upload your file to GitHub
